# Container Lifecycle Management

A comprehensive solution for managing Docker container lifecycles using AWS services.

## Features

- Automated container status tracking using CloudWatch events
- Automatic decommissioning of unused containers
- Container image cleanup
- Real-time notifications for abnormal container behavior
- Integration with Slack for alerts

## Architecture

The solution uses the following AWS services:
- AWS Lambda for container management logic
- CloudWatch Events for scheduling and monitoring
- SQS for message queuing
- SNS for notifications
- AWS CDK for infrastructure as code

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Python 3.9 or later
- Docker installed locally
- AWS CDK CLI installed

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

3. Deploy the infrastructure:
```bash
cdk deploy
```

4. Configure Slack webhook URL in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:
```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/container-lifecycle/slack-webhook" --type "SecureString" --value "your-slack-webhook-url"
```

## Usage

The system will automatically:
- Monitor container status every 5 minutes
- Clean up unused containers after 24 hours of inactivity
- Remove unused images
- Send notifications for:
  - Container crashes
  - High resource usage
  - Failed deployments
  - Security vulnerabilities

## Monitoring

- CloudWatch Logs: Container management logs
- CloudWatch Metrics: Container health metrics
- SNS Topics: Alert notifications
- Slack Channel: Real-time alerts

## Security

- IAM roles with least privilege
- Secure parameter storage
- VPC security groups
- Encryption at rest
